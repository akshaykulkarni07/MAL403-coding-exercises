# MAL403-coding-exercises
This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises for MAL403 - Numerical Linear Algebra open course offered by Mathematics Dept., VNIT, Nagpur

The questions of the assignment are as follows: 

1. Write a program to determine diagonal dominance (or otherwise) of given square matrix. Also find the magnitude of diagonal dominance (if so). 
2. Write a program for finding an estimate of condition number w.r.t. infinity norm for a diagonally dominant square matrix A.
3. Write a program which gives the solution of the linear system, Ax = b, where A is diagonal, lower triangular, upper triangular, unitary.
4. Write a program to find solution of the linear system Ax = b using Gauss Elimination with trivial pivoting.
5. Write a program to find solution of the linear system Ax = b using Gauss Elimination with partial pivoting.
6. Write a program to find solution of the linear system Ax = b using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
7. Write a program to find inverse of non-singular matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
8. Write a progam to decompose non-singular matrix A as product LU of lower and upper triangular matrices L and U respectively.
